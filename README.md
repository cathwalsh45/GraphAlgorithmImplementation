####  Graph algorithm implementation
This repository conteins my Python3 implementation of graph algorithm described in article [*"Simple and accurate analytical calculation of shortest path lengths"*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05521.pdf) by S.Melnik and James P. Gleeson.

This work was an exercise project on the course CS-E5745 Mathematical Methods for Network Science in department of computer science at Aalto University, Finland. The code is available at [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19UoafUIfwxlVPNjfOjpNevPMzZc8QaHa).
